A WordPress widget that displays the last edited posts and pages. It displays recent edits to _all_ posts, not just those outwith the n most recent posts.

Based on [Recently updated posts widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recently-updated-posts-widget/) by luciole135. Most of the credit should go to this project - I merely tweaked a few bits of code.
